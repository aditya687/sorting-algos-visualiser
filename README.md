# sorting-algos-visualiser
A web application is created using HTML, CSS, Javascript to visualize how various sorting
algorithms work

Check this website -> https://sort-algo-visualise.netlify.app/


We have learnt sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort.
But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we
are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about
these algorithms is visualization.


Thatâ€™s why we'll be making this project to let everyone understand how these algorithms
work and through this project we'll also know to get a deep understanding of such sorting
algorithms.
